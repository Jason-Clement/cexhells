This is a [HexCells](http://www.matthewbrowngames.com/hexcellsinfinite.html) editor I'm building in javascript.

There is a hexcells editor already in existence by [oprypin](https://github.com/oprypin) that can be found [here](https://github.com/oprypin/sixcells).

I wanted to make my own for funzies. I'm not sure I'll actually finish it.
